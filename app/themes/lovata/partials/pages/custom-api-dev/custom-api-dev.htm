            <p class="landing-page__text">LOVATA Company has immense expertise in developing APIs to establish a standard point of data access for omnichannel products and solutions that have multiple mobile app and web interfaces. We are also experts in building powerful API solutions to share data between complex software systems. Our APIs are custom-tailored to your system. The data may be accessed by all parties involved in the API infrastructure or the access may be limited, where certain restrictions and policies are applied and access keys are assigned to each party.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Our vast API development experience includes working on a complex and feature-rich  healthcare solution. We implemented an API interface that interconnected all of the solution’s web and mobile interfaces, the CRM (which was also custom designed by LOVATA) and the service’s partnership programs with medical institutions and insurance companies.

            <h2 class="landing-page__title">Advantages Of Custom API Development</h2>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Your website can become much more powerful if you enable it to communicate with other websites and services. Since the rise of the cloud era embedding custom APIs has become vital for both B2B and B2C organizations. It allows them to gravitate more clients towards their services and considerably increase revenues.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Here are some pivotal benefits that custom APIs procure:</p>

            <ul class="landing-page__list landing-page__plus-list">
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Building a loyal client base and increasing conversion rates.</span> Providing users with integrated third-party services and granting them access to information from external assets allows you to avoid situations where you lose your client when he has to turn to google or other web sources for supplemental information and guidance (e.g. google maps, currency exchange rates, weather portals, etc.).</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Automated data transfer and business processes.</span> Custom APIs allow you to automate workflows which would otherwise require manual intervention. Multiple pages of a website can be updated simultaneously, saving the costs and time of updating the system on a regular basis. A custom API can also revamp traditional business processes to save time and increase productivity.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Incorporate partnership programs to benefit your business.</span> Like-minded organizations with a philosophy that coincides with that of your team can repurpose your products and create new offerings and applications to the services your company provides. This often leads to innovation when people with bright ideas build new apps that further boost your revenues.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Increased efficiency for omnichannel solutions.</span> Custom APIs enable content to be developed once and spread across multiple platforms and interfaces without the need to build individual products for each platform leading to excessive expenses.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Harnessing the power of the cloud.</span> Our Custom API integration services allow us to connect your solutions with the most prominent remote storage providers: Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Google and others. If your business relies on file storage and managing documents or providing users with such services, a custom cloud API is required. Moving to cloud computing potentially paves the way to such trending innovative technologies as AI, Machine Learning and Blockchain.</li>
