            <h2 class="landing-page__title">Why You Need Business Analysis</h2>
            <p class="landing-page__text">At LOVATA, a typical project usually starts with discussing the client’s ideas and evaluating them from the standpoint of the product owner and the developer. In most cases, the client’s idea is too raw to rapidly begin development, as he/she might not have a clear understanding of all the details and complications that go into implementation. Not to mention, the client might not even have a clear enough vision of what exactly he wants to see in the end solution.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Ideas for projects come in many forms: it can be a case of pure inspiration, a comprehensive and thorough research or a result of a detailed, extensive business and competitive environment analysis. The latter is the best-case scenario as the project is being given a full set of requirements and documentation needed to jump-start product development.</p>

            <h3 class="landing-page__sub-heading">Why Not Just Choose Software Developers?</h3>
            <p class="landing-page__text">You might think that working with an experienced team of software developers is enough to transform your ideas into a fully functioning product with features that satisfy all your clients’ needs. However, that is generally not the case, as developers are not qualified enough to elicit project requirements and collect all the necessary information required for your business’ success.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Your business can have small details, edge cases, exceptions and various business logic that developers will most likely not take into consideration, as they don’t always have the experience and insight to address what is most important for you as a business owner.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">In order to translate your ideas into a comprehensive project requirements specification that developers will be able to understand and implement into a working solution that caters all your business needs, a person must have extensive knowledge in the business domain and experience working across multiple industries. This is where LOVATA’s business system analyst comes in.</p>

            <h2 class="landing-page__title">Business Analysis Processes</h2>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Working alongside the development team, our business analyst goes through several phases of business analysis, compiling and documenting various specifications, creating visualizations and diagrams to make the development process as clear to the client as possible.</p>
            <p class="landing-page__text">Our typical Business analysis comprises of the following processes:</p>
            <ul class="landing-page__list landing-page__numbers-list">
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Client and organization analysis.</span> During this stage the business analyst tries to figure out who exactly the client is, the structure of the organization, the key business roles and who the analyst needs to talk to (e.g. specialists in a certain field) to understand the business goals and strategies of the client and to eventually mould the actual project requirements.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Current state analysis.</span> This is a critical step in the process of business analysis, as it defines the current state of various business processes in the organization, the details vital to the specific business domain and the state of currently implemented systems and their functionality. This is where we can understand which processes we need to integrate with and, possibly, which parts of the system have already been implemented.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Formulating the scope document.</span> Defining the scope of the project is the fundamental phase of business analysis for any project. The scope document contains the technical requirements specification and answers the following questions:
                    <ul class="landing-page__list landing-page__dots-list landing-page__dots-list_inner">
                        <li class="landing-page__list-item">What are the business needs, what is the purpose of the solution?</li>
                        <li class="landing-page__list-item">What are the benefits of the solution?</li>
                        <li class="landing-page__list-item">What features are to be implemented?</li>
                        <li class="landing-page__list-item">What are the business scenarios (for each product feature)?</li>
                        <li class="landing-page__list-item">What is the scope of the solution, are there any plans to scale the solution in the future?</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Functional requirements analysis.</span> LOVATA  Company takes advantage of the Agile development methodology and captures functional requirements, which define the capabilities of the system, through user stories that are documented in the Product Backlog.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Creating wireframes and other visual documents.</span> Our Business analyst works alongside the designer to create snapshots and wireframes of the user interface for the client to have a clear vision of the current state of development. LOVATA’s experts may also create functional prototypes for the client to experiment with and determine which functionality actually needs to be implemented. We also often use workflow diagrams to illustrate business processes and functional requirements in a more approachable way.</li>
                <li class="landing-page__list-item"><span class="landing-page__list-item-title">Managing project changes & updates.</span> Throughout the project development process and usually towards the end of the current development cycle the business analyst updates the requirements specification in order to reflect the functionality that was actually implemented and any changes that the client might need to be made to the original set of project requirements. The analyst also prepares documentation for the next sprint.</li>
